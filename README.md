# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project is a machine learning implementation for predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign using Logistic Regression. It is based on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#breast-cancer-dataset) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in women worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve survival rates. This project aims to build a predictive model using logistic regression to classify tumors based on diagnostic features.
